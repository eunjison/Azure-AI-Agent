      "To answer this request we have assembled the following team:\n",
      "\n",
      "FileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\n",
      "WebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n",
      "Coder: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\n",
      "ComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks).\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Here is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS  \n",
      "- The request asks for the current stock price and outlook (prospects) of Microsoft.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. FACTS TO LOOK UP  \n",
      "- Microsoft's current stock price (as of the latest market close or real-time quote). This can be found on financial news websites such as Yahoo Finance, Google Finance, Bloomberg, or official stock exchanges (NASDAQ where MSFT is listed).  \n",
      "- Recent news and analysis concerning Microsoft’s business performance, product launches, financial reports, strategic initiatives, or market trends that affect its outlook. Sources can include financial news outlets (CNBC, MarketWatch, Reuters), official Microsoft financial disclosures (investor relations page), and analyst reports.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. FACTS TO DERIVE  \n",
      "- Based on the gathered data, derive a concise and balanced summary of Microsoft’s near-term and longer-term prospects, considering factors like market position, innovation, competitive landscape, and economic conditions.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. EDUCATED GUESSES  \n",
      "- Given Microsoft’s historic resilience and leadership in cloud computing (Azure), software, and enterprise services, it is likely to have a generally positive long-term outlook.  \n",
      "- The stock price likely reflects broad market conditions, technology sector trends, and investor sentiment regarding large-cap growth stocks.  \n",
      "- Potential risks might include economic downturns, regulatory scrutiny, and competitive pressures.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Here is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n",
      "\n",
      "- Ask WebSurfer to look up Microsoft’s current stock price on a reliable financial website (e.g., Yahoo Finance, Google Finance).  \n",
      "- Request WebSurfer to gather recent news, analyst reports, and official financial updates from Microsoft’s investor relations page and major financial news sources to assess the company’s outlook.  \n",
      "- Summarize the combined data into a clear, concise report covering both the current stock price and a balanced view of the company’s near-term and long-term prospects.  \n",
      "- No immediate need for FileSurfer, Coder, or ComputerTerminal unless a detailed financial dataset or computation is required later.\n",

Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\\nCoder: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks).\\n\\n\\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\\n\\n1. GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS  \\n- The request asks for the current stock price and outlook (prospects) of Microsoft.\\n\\n2. FACTS TO LOOK UP  \\n- Microsoft's current stock price (as of the latest market close or real-time quote). This can be found on financial news websites such as Yahoo Finance, Google Finance, Bloomberg, or official stock exchanges (NASDAQ where MSFT is listed).  \\n- Recent news and analysis concerning Microsoft’s business performance, product launches, financial reports, strategic initiatives, or market trends that affect its outlook. Sources can include financial news outlets (CNBC, MarketWatch, Reuters), official Microsoft financial disclosures (investor relations page), and analyst reports.\\n\\n3. FACTS TO DERIVE  \\n- Based on the gathered data, derive a concise and balanced summary of Microsoft’s near-term and longer-term prospects, considering factors like market position, innovation, competitive landscape, and economic conditions.\\n\\n4. EDUCATED GUESSES  \\n- Given Microsoft’s historic resilience and leadership in cloud computing (Azure), software, and enterprise services, it is likely to have a generally positive long-term outlook.  \\n- The stock price likely reflects broad market conditions, technology sector trends, and investor sentiment regarding large-cap growth stocks.  \\n- Potential risks might include economic downturns, regulatory scrutiny, and competitive pressures.\\n\\n\\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\\n\\n- Ask WebSurfer to look up Microsoft’s current stock price on a reliable financial website (e.g., Yahoo Finance, Google Finance).  \\n- Request WebSurfer to gather recent news, analyst reports, and official financial updates from Microsoft’s investor relations page and major financial news sources to assess the company’s outlook.  \\n- Summarize the combined data into a clear, concise report covering both the current stock price and a balanced view of the company’s near-term and long-term prospects.  \\n- No immediate need for FileSurfer, Coder, or ComputerTerminal unless a detailed financial dataset or computation is required later.\\n\", type='TextMessage'),

Sign up at https://www.alphavantage.co/ to get a free API key.\\n2. Use their TIME_SERIES_INTRADAY or GLOBAL_QUOTE endpoint to fetch the current MSFT stock price.\\n3.

It requires installing `yfinance` via:\\n\\n```sh\\npip install yfinance\\n```\\n\\n---\\n\\n**To summarize:**\\n\\n- For reliable and official data, use Alpha Vantage or IEX Cloud with API keys.\\n- For quick development and fallback, use `yfinance` Python library which can fetch both the current stock price and recent news.\\n- Let me know if you\\'d like me to run the `yfinance` approach or
